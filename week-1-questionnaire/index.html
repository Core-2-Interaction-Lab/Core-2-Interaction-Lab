    <h1> Prompts</h1>
    <p>
        My previous experience with coding is at an ammaetuer level.
        I've learned the basics of WEB DESIGN and html/css. I mainly
        used Square Space, and WiX for my previous projects.         
        I believe in my last Interaction class, learning HTML/CSS had 
        resonated with me. I believe the most confusing part of coding
        is JavaScript. Since thereâ€™s so many commands, and it tends
        to get confusing from time to time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm a bit nervous in learning code, since it looks complicated and confusing.
        I believe the parts which I tend to get stuck on alot, are the commands. Since,
        I'm not entirely sure which commands are which unless there's a guide for me.
    </p>

        I imagine coding fitting in everything in my desing curriculum and 
        possibly my career after college. I feel like it's something unavoidable, and 
        it has to be utilized in my career eventually. Therefore learning some basics
        of HTML/CSS/Javascript would be very helpful later on.
    </p>

    <p>
        I prefer using the Visual Code Editor for text editing.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've used Github before from my previous Interaction course. I understand
        the basics of how to utilize Github, and I understand that the purpose of
        Github is to create WebSites, or Web platforms that can be published onto 
        the internet.

        The relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript can be described as builders
        who work along side one another. Sometimes their functions may overlap one another,
        however if they are used properly they can build a proper functional house.

            This is my go to site if I'm looking for some inspiration for my next 
            Design project. It's nice to use it as a reference to improve my Graphics
            skills.

            This site I'll tend to use as my moodboard for organizing my ideas. This 
            site helps keeps my ideas in track, and it efficiently utilizes them.
