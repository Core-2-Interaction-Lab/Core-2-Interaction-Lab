            <p>
                The web design itself is pretty bad. The codes founded while
                inspecting were questionable. I couldn't understand the choices 
                of the visual design and some of the codes displayed onto the 
                inspector. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The webpage codes, had css styles in the html, making it difficult to
                read or understand. There was very little cordination and organization,
                since most of the codes were css and it was everywhere. So, I got rid most
                of the css styles, and left most of the tables and grids on the html.
                Leaving most of the images,  buttons, and other functions that should
                be in the html file. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The webpage should have a seperate folder, perhaps assets, where 
                they have put their images and buttons in there. Along with a 
                stylesheet file, where they can go back to re-edit their css
                and website design. They should also properly add their grids and 
                flexbox in their css file, if they were to create one. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, they need to work on their homepage, and their links, or 
                they're overall presentation. Possibly by adding more navigation
                functions, insteaad of having all the links in one page or the homepage.
                Some of the text, and typefaces used were questionable, along with
                their background image. This wasn't a professionlly made website,
                since most of the aesthetics felt tacky.
