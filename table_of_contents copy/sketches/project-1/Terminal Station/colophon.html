                    This site was built with my knowledge of coding with HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. Along with the help of two programs, GitHub and Visual Studio Code.

                The theme for this interactive site is inspired by the escape room idea of an post-apocalyptic, abandoned underground train terminal station.

                The narrations is provided as a guide to help users navigate around the website. 
                <br><br>
                Users are greeted with the “Welcome to The End.” along with following texts right after, that helps set the mood for storytelling. 
                <br><br>
                The users will encounter some texts from the story, “On Beginnings” which, the main goal is to escape the underground train station.

                “I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated.”
