    <div class="end">.THE END
        <br><br>
.And it was<br>
.and it was finally time to go in<br>
,her whole life<br>
,exploring the earth<br>
,spoke as if she had been out<br>
,cloistered<br>
,homebound<br>
,A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in<br>
.Among Emily Dickinson’s last words (in a letter)<br>
.But it is growing damp and I must go in<br>
<br><br>
.Go to sleep now<br>
.Don’t be afraid<br>
.I am here with you<br>
.I love you<br>
:like a refrain<br>
,in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after night<br>
:that beginning and that end are the same<br>
,And in the best of all possible lives<br>
.by those we listen to<br>
,that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others<br>
,reading these first and last lines<br>
,And i began to realize <br>
.because the words belong to completely different poems<br>
,Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct<br>
.even repeated<br>
,and that last lines are remarkably similar<br>
,even repeated<br>
,and I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar <br>
,across aesthetic schools<br>
,across cultures<br>
,across ages<br>
,reading hundreds of opening and closing lines<br>
,I have flipped through books <br>
<br><br>
.and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born<br>
,but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge<br>
,we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning<br>
,before the universe burst into being<br>
-It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang<br>
?How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace<br>
.But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin<br>
<br><br>
“.an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled<br>
,to use another familiar set of terms<br>
,Or<br>
.and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released<br>
,is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences<br>
,and even this may be too much<br>
,Perhaps all we can say”<br>
:says this<br>
,A Study of How Poems End<br>
:in her book Poetic Closure<br>
,Barbara Henstein Smith<br>
<br><br>
.Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell<br>
.The poem is the consequence of its origins<br>
.origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings)<br>
:Bachelard’s sentence simply says this<br>
<br><br>
.Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work<br>
.usually Dante<br>
,usually poetry<br>
,Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings<br>
.Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say<br>
<br><br>
“.The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim”<br>
, on a scrap of paper<br>
:The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom<br>
<br><br>
.not the word<br>
,then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act<br>
 ,And if you believe that<br>
.It is the one try inevitable thing<br>
.I am afraid there is no way around this<br>
<br><br>
.think about it<br>
,by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it<br>
,the loss of some vitality through familiarization<br>
,the least we can do is dignify our knowingness<br>
;and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification<br>
—it could also be horror<br>
—vital and fresh<br>
,The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered<br>
.We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment<br>
:Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing<br>
<br><br>
.do something unexpectedly incongruent<br>
,the ending will have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette<br>
:Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing <br>
<br><br>
.Which is a wonderful thing <br>
.And I realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great <br>
.were the words The End<br>
.And so they sign their poems and stories like kings<br>
.but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet<br>
,of course<br>
,they know some<br>
;and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written<br>
,achievement for them to have written anything<br>
,beautifully apart from the rest of the text<br>
,in India ink<br>
,and at the bottom of the page<br>
,And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade<br>
.no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line<br>
,I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy<br>
.I wonder<br>
,Why is that<br>
.read a poem that ended with the words The End<br>
,in my life<br>
,I have never<br>
<br><br>
.the sadness of having finished the book<br>
,and the feeling of loss<br>
,a feeling of satisfaction<br>
,both the feeling of being replete<br>
:with a deep sense of feeling<br>
,even if only silently<br>
,I read them<br>
,I didn’t ignore them<br>
.It was its own thrill<br>
<br><br>
.are the dark letters spelling The End<br>
,at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence<br>
,I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page<br>
.The End<br>
:huge scrolled words come on the screen and say<br>
,I miss watching a movie and at the end<br>
:I will tell you what I miss<br>
<br><br>
.not you to them or they to you<br>
,Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other<br>
.Would not speak to each other<br>
.the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other<br>
,and if it were not for the poem that intervenes<br>
—a poem<br>
—Between the first and last lines there exists<br>
. the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart<br>
,what connects the first line to the last <br>
,a living semicolon <br>
,You might say a poem is a semicolon<br>
<br><br>
. that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated<br>
—an Italian as a matter of fact<br>
—invented by a human being<br>
, used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing<br>
<br><br>
-is the least<br>
, by the way<br>
,which<br>
(but the next time you use a semicolon, the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant<br>
; he is absolutely right<br>
“!That’s a lot of semicolons” <br>
:he said<br>
,When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence<br>
<br><br>
. they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end<br>
, if you are blessed<br>
,Or<br>
. the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand<br>
, or in a nursing home<br>
, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine<br>
, toddling around the kitchen<br>
, That sentence begins with your first words<br>
. that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime<br>
—English among them<br>
—Some languages are so constructed<br>
: This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa<br>
.something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow<br>
,Now here is something really interesting (to me)<br>
<br><br>
. they will get the wrong idea<br>
,or tell it too loudly<br>
,but if you tell too many faces this <br>
, I believe many fine poems begin with ideas<br>
<br><br>
.This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error<br>
. at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed<br>
, a dead-end alley<br>
, you are on the wrong path<br>
,an exact grid of intent<br>
,if you have any idea for a poem <br>
:and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn <br>
, And the lesson is always the same<br>
. or imagined<br>
,witnessed<br>
, heard<br>
, something seen<br>
, an image<br>
, a rhythm<br>
, a scrap of language<br>
, a line<br>
, a phrase<br>
: the answer is always the same<br>
,Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin<br>
<br><br>
.self-consciousness is theatre<br>
, in other words<br>
; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle<br>
; but no theater<br>
,has in his actions drama<br>
, Johnny Ferret<br>
, an animal of only instinct<br>
; the weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives<br>
“.The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit” <br>
, As the poet Ralph angel puts it<br>
. the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre<br>
; and has been from its beginning<br>
, because self-consciousness is its own pretension<br>
, yes and always<br>
, too<br>
, That<br>
.  impersonate<br>
,feign<br>
, to pretend<br>
. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure<br>
.How a poem acts marks its individual character <br>
. to behave<br>
, To conduct oneself<br>
!has to exist <br>
, no matter how full of possibility<br>
, But the poem<br>
!Hard lot <br>
. They love to wonder and explore<br>
! And poets love possibility<br>
.A state of real existence rather than possibility<br>
.Be an act of Congress <br>
. to make manifest<br>
, to make happen<br>
,To move<br>
.An act of the mind<br>
<br><br>
. and it's your house<br>
, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice<br>
,somehow this happens <br>
; often against our own will<br>
, the mind wills a poem<br>
, The mind acts<br>
. it begins in the mind<br>
, but it begins off the page<br>
, Because the poem ends on the page<br>
. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning<br>
. I believe the poem is an act of the mind<br>
<br><br>
.no pervasive love before some kind of act <br>
,no thought before act <br>
, no breath before act<br>
—that nothing can precede action<br>
. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act<br>
.Western civilization rests upon those words <br>
. In the beginning was the Word<br>
<br><br>
. and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall<br>
, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before<br>
, is like finding a fruit on the ground<br>
,he said<br>
, the opening line of a poem<br>
: that i have never forgotten it<br>
, and to my mind so accurately<br>
,Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly<br>
<br><br>
. for where quotations begin is in a cloud<br>
, This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé<br>
. that every poem is merely abandoned<br>
,once said that no poem is ever ended <br>
, the French poet and thinker<br>
, Paul Valéry<br>
<br><br>
. but it is the ending of a poem without an end<br>
, which may be an ending<br>
, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind<br>
, one poem is abandoned<br>
—Not every poem is finished<br>
. the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it<br>
,In poetry<br>
<br><br>
.no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it <br>
:the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings<br>
, In life

                witnessed, <br>
                or imagined. <br>
                And the lesson is always the same, <br>

                a dead-end alley, <br>

                This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. <br>

                or tell it too loudly, <br>
                they will get the wrong idea. <br>
                <br><br>
                Now here is something really interesting (to me), <br>
                something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. <br>
                This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: <br>
                Some languages are so constructed—<br>
                English among them—<br>
                that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. <br>
                That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, <br>
                and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, <br>
                or in a nursing home, <br>
                the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. <br>
                Or, if you are blessed, <br>
                they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end. <br>
                <br><br>
                When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, <br>
                he said: <br>
                “That’s a lot of semicolons!” <br>

                but the next time you use a semicolon <br>
                (which, <br>
                by the way, <br>
                is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) <br>
                you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being— <br>
                an Italian as a matter of fact— <br>
                that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.  <br>
                <br><br>
                You might say a poem is a semicolon, <br>
                a living semicolon, <br>
                what connects the first line to the last,<br> 
                the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and last lines there exists—<br>
                a poem—<br>
                and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, <br>
                the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other. <br>
                <br><br>
                Would not speak to each other. <br>
                Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, <br>
                not you to them or they to you.<br>
                <br><br>
                I will tell you what I miss: <br>
                I miss watching a movie and at the end, <br>
                huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: <br>
                The End. 
                I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, <br>
                at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, <br>
                are the dark letters spelling The End. <br>
                <br><br>
                It was its own thrill. <br>
                I didn’t ignore them, <br>
                I read them, <br>
                even if only silently, <br>
                with a deep sense of feeling: <br>
                both the feeling of being replete, <br>
                a feeling of satisfaction, <br>
                and the feeling of loss, <br>
                the sadness of having finished the book. <br>
                <br><br>
                I have never, <br>
                in my life, <br>
                read a poem that ended with the words The End. <br>
                Why is that, <br>
                I wonder. <br>
                I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy, <br>
                no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. <br>
                And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, <br>
                and at the bottom of the page, <br>
                in India ink, <br>
                beautifully apart from the rest of the text, <br>
                were the words The End. <br>
                And I realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything, <br>
                and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; <br>
                they know some, <br>
                of course, <br>
                but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. <br>
                And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. <br>
                Which is a wonderful thing. <br>
                <br><br>
                Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: <br>
                the ending will have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette, <br>
                do something unexpectedly incongruent. <br>
                <br><br>
                Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: <br>
                We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment. <br>
                The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, <br>
                vital and fresh—<br>
                it could also be horror—<br>
                and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification; <br>
                the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, <br>
                the loss of some vitality through familiarization, <br>
                by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, <br>
                think about it. <br>
                <br><br>
                I am afraid there is no way around this. <br>
                It is the one try inevitable thing. <br>
                And if you believe that, <br>
                then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, <br>
                not the word. <br>
                <br><br>
                The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, <br>
                on a scrap of paper: <br>
                “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”<br>
                <br><br>
                Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. <br>
                Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, <br>
                usually Dante. <br>
                Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work. <br>
                <br><br>
                Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: <br>
                origins <br>
                (beginnings)<br>
                have consequences <br>
                (endings).<br>
                <br><br>
                The poem is the consequence of its origins. <br>
                Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. <br>
                <br><br>
                Barbara Henstein Smith, <br>
                in her book Poetic Closure: <br>
                A Study of How Poems End, <br>
                says this: <br>
                “Perhaps all we can say, <br>
                and even this may be too much, <br>
                is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, <br>
                and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. <br>
                Or, <br>
                to use another familiar set of terms, <br>
                an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”<br>
                <br><br>
                But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? <br>
                It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—<br>
                we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, <br>
                before the universe burst into being,<br>
                but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, <br>
                and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born. <br>
                <br><br>
                I have flipped through books, <br>
                reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, <br>
                across ages, <br>
                across cultures, <br>
                across aesthetic schools, <br>
                and I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, <br>
                even repeated, <br>
                and that last lines are remarkably similar, <br>
                even repeated. <br>
                Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, <br>
                because the words belong to completely different poems. <br>
                And i began to realize, <br>
                reading these first and last lines, <br><br>
                that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, <br>
                by those we listen to. <br>
                And in the best of all possible lives, <br>
                that beginning and that end are the same: <br>
                in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after night, <br>
                like a refrain: <br>
                I love you. <br>
                I am here with you. <br>
                Don’t be afraid. <br>
                Go to sleep now. <br>
                And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: <br>
                I love you. <br>
                I am here with you. <br>
                Don’t be afraid. <br>
                Go to sleep now. <br>
                <br><br>
                But it is growing damp and I must go in. <br>
                Memory’s fog is rising. <br>
                Among Emily Dickinson’s last words <br>
                (in a letter). <br>
                A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, <br>
                homebound, <br>
                cloistered, <br>
                spoke as if she had been out, <br>
                exploring the earth, <br>
                her whole life, <br>
                and it was finally time to go in. <br>
                And it was.  <br><br>
