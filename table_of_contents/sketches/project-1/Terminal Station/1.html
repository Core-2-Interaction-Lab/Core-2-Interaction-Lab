        <span class="p1">On Beginnings,</span><br><br>
        <span class="p2">In life, <br>
            the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: <br>
            no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it. </span><br>
        <span class="p3">
            In poetry, 
            the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it. <br>
            Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, <br>
            another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, <br>
            which may be an ending, <br>
            but it is the ending of a poem without an end.  <br>
            </span><br>
        <span class="p4">
            Paul Valéry, <br>
            the French poet and thinker, <br>
            once said that no poem is ever ended, <br>
            that every poem is merely abandoned. <br>
            This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, <br>
            for where quotations begin is in a cloud.</span><br><br>
        <span class="p5">Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, <br>
            and to my mind so accurately, <br>
            that i have never forgotten it: <br>
            the opening line of a poem, <br>
            he said, <br>
            is like finding a fruit on the ground, <br>
            a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, <br>
            and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall. <br>
            </span><br>
        <span class="p6">
            In the beginning was the Word. <br>
            Western civilization rests upon those words. <br>
            And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the <br>
             beginning was the Act. <br>
            that nothing can precede action—</span><br><br>
        <span class="p7">no breath before act,</span><br><br>
        <span class="p8">no thought before act, </span><br><br>
        <span class="p9">no pervasive love before some kind of act. </span><br>
