    <h1> Prompts</h1>
    1. Describe your previous experiences with coding.
    <p>
        My previous experience with coding is at an ammaetuer level.
        I've learned the basics of WEB DESIGN and html/css. I mainly
        used Square Space, and WiX for my previous projects.         
        I believe in my last Interaction class, learning HTML/CSS had 
        resonated with me. I believe the most confusing part of coding
        is JavaScript. Since thereâ€™s so many commands, and it tends
        to get confusing from time to time.
    </p>

    2. How excited about learning code are you?
    <p>
        I'm a bit nervous in learning code, since it looks complicated and confusing.
        I believe the parts which I tend to get stuck on alot, are the commands. Since,
        I'm not entirely sure which commands are which unless there's a guide for me.
    </p>

    3. How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?
    <p>
        I imagine coding fitting in everything in my desing curriculum and 
        possibly my career after college. I feel like it's something unavoidable, and 
        it has to be utilized in my career eventually. Therefore learning some basics
        of HTML/CSS/Javascript would be very helpful later on.
    </p>

    4. What text editor do you prefer to use?
    <p>
        I prefer using the Visual Code Editor for text editing.
    </p>

    5. Have you used Github before?
    <p>
        I've used Github before from my previous Interaction course. I understand
        the basics of how to utilize Github, and I understand that the purpose of
        Github is to create WebSites, or Web platforms that can be published onto 
        the internet.
    </p>

    6. Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    <p>
        The relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript can be described as builders
        who work along side one another. Sometimes their functions may overlap one another,
        however if they are used properly they can build a proper functional house. 
    </p>

    7. Use HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance.
    <p>

    8. Create an unordered list and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related websites.

            <a href="https://milanote.com/">Milanote</a>: This site I'll tend to use as my moodboard for organizing my ideas. This 
            site helps keeps my ideas in track, and it efficiently utilizes them.
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a>:  This is my go to site if I'm looking for some inspiration for my next 
            Design project. It's nice to use it as a reference to improve my Graphics
            skills.
        </ul>
            
        </p>

    9. Insert an image that brings you joy to the page

        <br>
          <!-- i like cats -->
        <br>

    15. Create an unordered list of at least 6 musical artists you like to listen to. Add a class to each list item that matches the genre of music of that artist.

        <a id = "Blackpink">

    16. Describe the difference between block, inline-block and inline elements.
        <p>
            In contrast to inline elements, block level elements have top and bottom margins.
            A new line does not begin with an inline element. 
            The inline element takes up as much width necessary.
        </p>

    17. Use CSS to style the musical genre classes you added in question 9. Give each genre a color and personality using CSS.
        <p>
            <style>
            #Blackpink{color: rgba(255, 0, 238, 0.573);}
            #Billie{color: rgb(0, 128, 255);}
            #Ed{color: rgb(195, 110, 0);}
            #Halsey{color: rgb(13, 171, 118);}
            #Mars{color: rgb(186, 0, 0);}

            </style>
        </p>

    18. Use any CSS knowledge you currently have to style your questionnaire in a unique way. Make sure to update the font to something other than the default (use the font-family css property).
        <p>
            <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
            <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
            <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
            <style> body {
                font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
                background-color : rgb(184, 209, 206);
                padding : 275px;
                line-height: 40px;
                }
            </style>
        </p>

    19. In a script tag, use the console.log function to write a message to the console (Cmd+Opt+U). Tell me something interesting about yourself.
    <p>
        <script>
        console.log("Cat videos and pictures heals my soul.");
        </script>
    </p>
